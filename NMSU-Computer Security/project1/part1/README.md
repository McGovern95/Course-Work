 Using the cipher program:

1) "make" command to compile everything
2) ./part1 to run the program
3) The ciphertext is displayed.
4) Enter your cipher - note that it should be in freqruency(greatest to least) order, not alphabetical.
5) The program displays and sorts cipher based on your key, also displays letter freq. 
6) Let the manual permutation begin!
