I was able to find the true key using my program and refering to Answer #2 from this link on good manual permutation techniques: 
https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/42944/to-decrypt-a-cipher-text-encrypted-using-keyed-substitution


I first focues on swapping the ETAOINS from the letter freq key because those were the most common letters and would increase/decrease my score the most when changed, then I focused on the first couple
of words in the cipher and from there it was easy to permutate the rest by just eyeballing it.
